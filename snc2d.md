#### Mitosis vs Meiosis
- Mitosis: 
    - 2 daughter cells is identical to the parent cell
    - Occur in somatic (non-reproductive body cells)
- Meiosis: 2 different cell make a new cell
- Grow: Mitosis
- Repair: Mitosis
- Reproduce
    - Asexual: Mitosis
    - Sexual: Meiosis

### Interphase
- **G1**: [[#Organelles]] duplicate, Normal life functions
- **S** (synthesis): [[#DNA]] replication
- **G2**: Continue growth, Normal life functions
- $90\%=20\%+50\%+20\%$
- **Not** in Mitosis
### Prophase

- 35% in Cervix (Narrow neck)
- 35% in Mouth and Throat
- 4% in Penile (male)
- Major cause: Weak immune system, infertility, obesity
- Cancer test: Cervical sampling (takes cell sample)

### How HPV develop Cancer
- Infect Epithelium cells, glandular cells
- Takes 10 - 30 years to develop
1. HPV insert DNA into the nucleus which produce Oncoproteins E6 and E7
2. E6 and E7 disrupts proofreading process of the cell
3. E6 and E7 promotes tumor and malfunction (Mutation)
4. Accumulation of mutation causes Cancer
